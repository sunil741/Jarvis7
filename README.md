# Jarvis7
Aritficial intelligence for user communication and comfort
The application is made to mimic the ariticial intelligence JARVIS created and used by Tony Stark aka Iron Man
The user is asked to provide a username with which he will be referenced.
The user can use the application to set alarm,message his friend and maybe modified to do any other actvities.
You can  also ideate many more things by exploring many more libraries.
When a user wants to communicate with his friend,he orders JARVIS to record and send his voice.
The message will then be recorded and will be converted into text format for easy communication and will be translated back into voice which will be read out by JARVIS after notifying the reciever and getting permission to read it out through voice command
